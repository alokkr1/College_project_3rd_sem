                Netflix might not be playing nicely with Google TV for some reason, but the company is pouring tons of resources into its Android app. The service got variable playback speeds and a screen lock feature this year, and now it looks like we're in for audio-only
                background playback. It could help you save some precious mobile data or leave your phone in your pocket while you're keeping up with your favorite series.
            </p>

            <p>
                The feature was first spotted in an app teardown by our friends at XDA Developers back in October, but it wasn't functional back then. Now it comes to the first few subscribers as part of a server-side rollout in version 7.84.1 build 28 35243. If you're
                in on the change, you'll see a new Video off button at the top of the full-screen video player. Tapping it turns on the audio-only mode, leaving you with a blank screen showing all playback controls including the scrub bar, forward and
                backward, speed, and so on. Even the brightness slider remains available, though it's pretty useless here.

            </p>
            <p>We've also spotted a new Audio Only option in settings. Tapping it opens a pop-up menu that lets you choose when you want to use the mode: Always On, Headphones or External Speakers, and Off. I could imagine that audio-only will work better
                for some shows than for others. I don't think I'd understand the storyline in something like American Horror Story or Breaking Bad without the visuals, but the mode could be well suited for sitcoms, stand-up comedy, and some documentaries.
                You might still want to switch to audio description under Audio & Subtitles when available.

            </p>


            <p>There’s also an audio-off option in the app’s settings, which lets viewers decide whether they always want the audio off or only when they’re using headphones or external speakers. It’s unclear when all Android users might receive this update;
                two Verge staffers weren’t able to access the audio-only mode just yet.</p>
            <p>This is an intriguing update, though, if only because audio is having a moment. There is, of course, all the buzz around the podcasting industry and Spotify’s efforts to overtake it, but also Twitter launching audio tweets and apps like Clubhouse
                and TikTok focusing on audio as critical to their success. I wouldn’t have expected Netflix to include an audio-only mode, but if it wants people to spend more time on the app, that means supporting them in situations when they can’t fully
                give their attention to a screen.

                Pokémon Go was ready to kick off a new major event in March. Battle League — which asks players to walk in order to gain entry — was similar in spirit to many of Niantic’s initiatives within its game, one that encourages players to leave home and socialize.
                But outside, COVID-19 was beginning to take hold. “I remember being like there’s no way that this could be, there’s no way that this is anything,” says Veronica Saron, Niantic’s product marketing manager. “I was so stupid. I had no idea.
                None of us had any idea.”
            </p>

            <p>
                By March, companies were beginning to send their employees to work from home. For Saron, her last day in the office included a meeting with the company’s CEO and a series of talking heads via video call. She hasn’t been back to the office since.
            </p>
            <p>Video games have thrived in the pandemic, with sales hitting all-time highs in roughly a decade. Development, like many other jobs, has continued from home. Even with some delays, studios like Naughty Dog, Insomniac, Sucker Punch, and more
                have managed to successfully release their big budget games this year. Stuck at home, audiences have been even more eager for experiences to pass the long hours.</p>


            <p>Pokémon Go is not like most games. Where titles that found popularity this year, like Animal Crossing or Among Us, are perfectly suited to sitting on the couch, Pokémon Go is about getting up, heading outside, and socializing in real life;
                look no further than Niatnic’s focus on in-person events every year. That won’t work in a pandemic. Even outdoors, large gatherings can still pose health threats. And though its development now proceeds through continued updates to an
                existing product, as opposed to the work required for a big, initial launch, Pokémon Go has a unique pressure point: a moral obligation to its players to keep them safe. This has always been the case, as the game has a list of accidents
                and tragedies tied to its name. The pandemic only makes the stakes higher. It’s ethically dubious to encourage any of your players to get outside, when medical professionals have asked them to not.</p>
            <p>“The current issue [of COVID] is existential to our game,” senior product manager Matt Slemon tells The Verge. “And if we just continue on as we’ve been continuing on and build features and sit on them until COVID’s over, that wouldn’t be
                right by our players.”</p>

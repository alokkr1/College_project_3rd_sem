                On October 22, when the US Elections were in the final stages, a Dutch researcher named Victor Gevers
                had shared screenshots of what appeared to be inside Trump's Twitter account. A security expert, Gevers
                apparently had access to Trump's DMs and could post tweets from his account, as reported by The Guardian
                in October.
            </p>

            <p>
                The White House, however, had denied reports of any such hacks back then. According to reports, Gevers
                had told Dutch media that Trump's account did not even have basic security measures like a two-factor
                authentication. He tried to hack into the account by guessing the password and was successful in his
                fifth attempt. Back then, Gevers had revealed the password too - maga2020!. This refers to Trump's
                election campaign, "Make America Great Again."

            </p>
            <p>Having hacked into Trump's account, Gevers also disclosed information and warned others how the account
                was not safe. Dutch media reported that he tagged the White House, the CIA and other agencies in order
                to warn them.

                Following a detailed probe, Dutch investigators have revealed that Gevers will not be charged because he
                hacked ethically. They said that hacking is a crime in Netherlands, but special circumstances like
                "responsible disclosure" ( as was in Gevers' case), prosecutors do not take the case forward.</p>

            <br><br>

            <p>According to a report in the Netherlands-based news portal nltimes.nl, the Dutch hackers found Trump's
                password because of a 2012 LinkedIn data breach involving a database of 117 million usernames and
                passwords. The password 'yourfired' - the erroneously spelled catchphrase for Trump's TV reality show
                'The Apprentice' - turned out to also work on his Twitter account.</p>
            <p>The hackers did not mean to do any harm or post anything from Trump's account as they were "testing the security on the account, and then they reported the vulnerability to Trump and the United States government". The hackers never heard back from Trump but they did get a message from the National Cyber Security Center saying that the American government had taken up the report. "Thank you for contacting us".

            <p>The fact that remakes of both Resident Evil 3 and Final Fantasy 7 arrive just a week apart is pretty incredible, especially because they couldn’t be more different in their approaches as far as a “remake” goes. While RE3 is a mostly faithful
                modernization of its original, Final Fantasy 7 is less a remake and more a complete reinvention. It swaps turn-based combat with exciting real-time action and expands the first leg of the original story by dozens of hours – including with
                a bit too much filler and some convoluted new plot points. The long wait for this revival may not be a perfect reunion, but with or without nostalgia in play, it’s still a great JRPG in its own right. Of course, Final Fantasy 7 Remake
                is actually only the first in what is planned to be a series of as-yet-unknown length that will, if it’s ever completed, retell the entire story of the 1997 JRPG classic. This game only covers the events that take place in the city of
                Midgar, where Cloud Strife and his freedom-fighting allies battle the evil Shinra corporation that run it. That means roughly the first five hours of the original have been stretched into a campaign that took me more than 33 hours to complete,
                and there are still a few optional stones I left unturned.
            </p>
            <p>While you can hack away at enemies all you want with the square button, doing so charges up your ATB bars, which you can then use on unique weapon abilities, equippable spells, and items. Pulling up the command menu to pick one of these things
                slows time to a crawl, letting you comfortably pick actions for your entire party in the middle of combat – but that persistent slow creep forward adds a tension to every choice that truly reminded me of the frantic decision making the
                original elicited. (There is a “Classic” mode difficulty option, but all it does is automate all your actions in combat apart from ATB use, making it a strange middle ground I didn’t enjoy.)</p>

            <p>You’ll often need to switch the character you’re controlling directly too, since each one feels like a specific tool for a certain job. Barrett can more easily shoot down flying enemies, Cloud can quickly increase stagger, Tifa can lay massive
                burst damage on exposed enemies, and Aerith can send out big healing or magic damage as needed. Swapping between them sort of feels more like switching weapons than people in the heat of things, especially if you need to jump onto another
                character to more quickly charge their ATB for a specific move. While I spent my most time with Cloud, I’d also find myself frequently switching between them just because they were each a lot of fun to use.</p>

            <p>FF7R’s weapon system also had me digging through menu management more than I would have liked, but it’s such an intriguing system overall that I didn’t mind nearly as much. As opposed to being the quickly replaced stat increases that they
                so often are in RPGs, new weapons are persistent items that you’ll gather, keep, and upgrade throughout the campaign. Each one has a unique ability that can be earned permanently through use – things like Aerith’s AoE Sorcerous Storm or
                Cloud’s awesome Infinity’s End finisher – and that always gave me an incentive to try a new weapon out. Each character only has around a half dozen to find total, so you don’t get a ton of these game-changing upgrades, but my party, weapons,
                and Materia shifted around so much anyway that things never went stale.</p>


            <p>The expectations around Final Fantasy 7 Remake are sky high, and it mostly manages to deliver. Its combat is top notch, its enemy variety kept me constantly entertained, and seeing this snippet of story fleshed out with real emotional arcs
                and the previously hidden humanity behind Midgar filled me with pure joy. The boring RPG filler and Kingdom Hearts-esque convolution that was inserted in between did stop my ear-to-ear grin from being constant, but never long enough to
                kill the mood completely. That leaves this remake as one that still delivered on letting me relive (part of) a classic in stupendous fashion, while also standing as a great RPG all its own.
